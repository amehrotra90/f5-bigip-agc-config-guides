========================================================================

Overview
--------

Welcome to the Guided Configuration API page. Guided Configuration API v1.0 allows you to use API to create, update, or delete configurations and their associated objects for the following use cases:

* :guilabel:`API Protection Proxy`: Allows you to configure the BIG-IP system as an API Protection Proxy.
* :guilabel:`Azure AD Application`: Allows you to configure the BIG-IP system as a SAML Service Provider and Azure AD as an Identity Provider for your mission-critical on-premise application.

These APIs are designed to make the deployment and management of applications on the BIG-IP system easier. Guided Configuration API v1.0 is supported on BIG-IP version 16.1.0. These APIs follow the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) model for both public and private consumption.
